To run this thing, have [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, browse to the root of the project, run `node web-server.js` and then browse to [http://localhost:8888/slides/index.html]([http://localhost:8888/slides/index.html) (preferably in a super awesome super browser) Use the right arrow to move through the sections and the down arrow to go through the slides for each section. If the control points down and isn't grayed out you've got more to see :)
